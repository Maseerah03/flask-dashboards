Review,Product Name
"My last mascara was Mac and I like this one better. It doesn’t smudge or crumble off. I don’t usually take it off and when I wake up I don’t have really bad panda eyes, I still have some transfer before my eyes but a quick wet wipe fixes it. It also stays on pretty well in water (if you’re not rubbing your eyes too much). I’m used to going swimming and the waterproof mascara goes everywhere but then seems to be permanently stuck to the skin

"Don't buy if you looking for liquid inside. Almost dry inside. Bad decision to buy beauty products online.
