"I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy M05 for just under INR 6500, and I must say, I am very impressed! For the price, this phone is an absolute steal and offers incredible value for money.The large display is a real highlight, providing a great viewing experience for day-to-day tasks. Despite being a budget phone, it has a premium feel in hand, which is a pleasant surprise. The build quality is solid, and it doesn’t feel cheap.Battery life is outstanding! It lasts all day with moderate use, and I don’t have to worry about charging frequently. Whether you're browsing the web, checking social media, or streaming videos, it gets the job done efficiently.While it's not a phone meant for heavy tasks like gaming or intensive apps, it excels at handling basic jobs like calling, texting, browsing, and light media consumption. It's perfect if you're looking for a reliable phone for everyday use without breaking the bank.Overall, I’m really happy with my purchase. If you're looking for a budget phone that does the essentials really well, the Samsung Galaxy M05 is an excellent choice!",2025-01-04,mobile

"Processor- Slow processor but i guess you cant ask for much in this price bracket, the UI is smooth most of the time and its good enough to use social media apps and to watch videos and allCamera- Not very good but well we cant ask for much in this price range.Screen- Its actually really good for normal day to day usage, the colours and the sharpness is very decent,  i dont like the inclusion of thick bezels but i guess again its the price segment so cant ask for much, viewing angles are kinda badBattery- will last you a whole day if you try, it couldve been better thoBuild- Its solid, yes it makes the phone heavy and bulky but yeah its solid and has a good in hand feeling",2024-12-03,mobile
"I've been using this Samsung phone for a bit, and here's the lowdown. Considering it costs around ₹6,500-₹7,000, I think it's a pretty great deal.Sure, there are some compromises. No fingerprint sensor (the face unlock compensates some what for that), and yeah, not having a charger in the box is a bit of a hassle if you don't already have one. The speakers could be better, and a Full HD display would've been nice.But let's be real, at this price point, you can't expect perfection. If you're like me and just need a reliable phone for everyday stuff – calls, texts, social media, and some streaming – this phone gets the job done.Gaming enthusiasts might want to look elsewhere, but for casual users, I think this Samsung device is a solid choice.Would I recommend? Absolutely, for basic usage.",2024-10-11,mobile

My review :Performance [ 4/5 ] - Gaming Performance good but you'll see some frame drops and lag somewhere while using but a great gaming experience at this price.Camera [ 3/5 ] - Very limit features in camera app and quality is also not good and you'll find better options in market at 20k.Battery [ 5/5 ] - Awesome battery life and 80w fast charging is crazy and will take about 40m-60m for 0-100%.Display [ 4.5/5 ] - Good display quality in this price segment.Software [ 4/5 ] - Somewhere a decent ui experience but if you are looking for a good ui then Samsung ofc will be the best option.Conclusion - If you are looking for a phone for normal use and don't use camera that much then it's a great choice but OnePlus as a company is not offering you something special  if you buy at by seeing their brand value and it's quite similar to Realme Mobiles.,2024-10-10,mobile
"I recently purchased the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, and it has truly exceeded my expectations, deserving a solid 5-star rating. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day.

I purchased this for my grandmother for 7500 in sale. I personally appreciate realme to bring this phone at very low price. This phone has a feature that is not even present in a mid range or flagship phone. Its power button being a fingerprint sensor is also a dynamic button. We could specify a function for it like adjusting volume by sliding on power button. It also have a clear hd display which is very bright in direct sunlight. This is the only phone in segment that comes with 10w fast charging. It is so light in weight and we can carry it anywhere comfortably. It is functioning properly without any hang or slowing down. So this is the best phone in the segment with armorshell protection which makes it so durable.,2025-02-06,mobile
"I've been using the realme Narzo N61 (Marble Black, 4GB RAM+64GB Storage) for a few weeks, and while it shows promise, it falls short in some areas.Pros:1. 90Hz Eye Comfort display: Smooth visuals, reduced eye strain.2. IP54 dust and water resistance: Added durability.3. 48-month fluency promise: realme's commitment to software updates.4. Charger included: Convenient.5. Affordable price point.Cons:1. Performance issues: Device can be slow, especially with multitasking.2. Occasional lag and freezing: Frustrating experience.3. Display touch issues: Unresponsive or inaccurate touch registration.4. Limited storage (64GB): May require frequent cleaning or expansion.Key Features:- 6.5"" HD+ display- MediaTek Helio G35 processor- 4GB RAM, 64GB storage (expandable up to 1TB)- 48MP primary camera, 2MP macro, 2MP depth sensor- 5000mAh battery- Android 12 (Realme UI 3.0)Verdict:The realme Narzo N61 has potential, but its performance and display issues hold it back. If you prioritize smooth performance and responsive touch, consider alternatives.Recommendation:Ideal for:- Basic users (calling, texting, social media)- Casual gaming (non-demanding titles)Not recommended for:- Demanding gamers- Multitaskers- Those seeking seamless performanceRating Breakdown:- Display: 3.5/5 (touch issues)- Performance: 3.0/5 (slow, laggy)- Battery: 4.0/5- Camera: 3.5/5- Value: 4.5/5Suggestions for realme:1.

Everything is great but has slow internet access like even in high speed wifi the phone can only access slow speeds with buffering internet and only useful for small tasks like social media cannot handle huge tasks like gaming.

"You get option of Disable and uninstall, but you cant uninstall some system apps. They recommend you to install some unnecessary apps and games. Do uncheck them. They say its 90hz refresh rate screen, but you dont get option of switching to 90hz permanently. 60hz option is there and other option is automatic.Build quality is good. Sound quality is decent, charging speed is very slow. Almost 3 hrs for full charge. And UI feels like light version of Realme UI. U dont get all features. May be because its a low budget phone.",2025-01-14,mobile

Touch Screen performance not good ..very slagesh.,2025-01-12,mobile
I purchased this for my grandmother for 7500 in sale. I personally appreciate realme to bring this phone at very low price. This phone has a feature that is not even present in a mid range or flagship phone. Its power button being a fingerprint sensor is also a dynamic button. We could specify a function for it like adjusting volume by sliding on power button. It also have a clear hd display which is very bright in direct sunlight. This is the only phone in segment that comes with 10w fast charging. It is so light in weight and we can carry it anywhere comfortably. It is functioning properly without any hang or slowing down. So this is the best phone in the segment with armorshell protection which makes it so durable.,2025-02-06,mobile
"I've been using the realme Narzo N61 (Marble Black, 4GB RAM+64GB Storage) for a few weeks, and while it shows promise, it falls short in some areas.Pros:1. 90Hz Eye Comfort display: Smooth visuals, reduced eye strain.2. IP54 dust and water resistance: Added durability.3. 48-month fluency promise: realme's commitment to software updates.4. Charger included: Convenient.5. Affordable price point.Cons:1. Performance issues: Device can be slow, especially with multitasking.2. Occasional lag and freezing: Frustrating experience.3. Display touch issues: Unresponsive or inaccurate touch registration.4. Limited storage (64GB): May require frequent cleaning or expansion.Key Features:- 6.5"" HD+ display- MediaTek Helio G35 processor- 4GB RAM, 64GB storage (expandable up to 1TB)- 48MP primary camera, 2MP macro, 2MP depth sensor- 5000mAh battery- Android 12 (Realme UI 3.0)Verdict:The realme Narzo N61 has potential, but its performance and display issues hold it back. If you prioritize smooth performance and responsive touch, consider alternatives.Recommendation:Ideal for:- Basic users (calling, texting, social media)- Casual gaming (non-demanding titles)Not recommended for:- Demanding gamers- Multitaskers- Those seeking seamless performanceRating Breakdown:- Display: 3.5/5 (touch issues)- Performance: 3.0/5 (slow, laggy)- Battery: 4.0/5- Camera: 3.5/5- Value: 4.5/5Suggestions for realme:1. Optimize software for better performance.2. Improve display touch sensitivity.3. Consider upgrading storage options.Would I recommend this product? Only for basic users.Please note that this review is based on my personal experience. Your mileage may vary.",2024-11-17,mobile
Nice product,2025-01-26,mobile
Everything is great but has slow internet access like even in high speed wifi the phone can only access slow speeds with buffering internet and only useful for small tasks like social media cannot handle huge tasks like gaming. Screen size is gud. Sound quality could be better but it sounds ok with single speaker,2025-01-13,mobile
"You get option of Disable and uninstall, but you cant uninstall some system apps. They recommend you to install some unnecessary apps and games. Do uncheck them. They say its 90hz refresh rate screen, but you dont get option of switching to 90hz permanently. 60hz option is there and other option is automatic.Build quality is good. Sound quality is decent, charging speed is very slow. Almost 3 hrs for full charge. And UI feels like light version of Realme UI. U dont get all features. May be because its a low budget phone.",2025-01-14,mobile

"***** A True Flagship Experience! *****I recently got my hands on the OnePlus 13, and I must say, this phone is a game-changer. OnePlus has truly outdone itself this time. Here's why:Design & BuildThe sleek design is stunning and feels premium in hand. The  finish on the back resists fingerprints, and the phone is surprisingly lightweight yet solid. It's definitely a head-turner!DisplayThe AMOLED display is gorgeous, with vibrant colors and buttery-smooth 120Hz refresh rate. Watching videos and gaming feels incredibly immersive, even under bright sunlight.PerformancePowered by the latest Snapdragon chipset, the phone is a beast! Multitasking is seamless, and gaming performance is top-notch with zero lags. Apps open in an instant, and the overall performance feels lightning-fast.SoftwareThe OxygenOS experience is clean and intuitive. The new customizations and smooth animations make the Ulleven more enjoyable.VerdictIf you're looking for a flagship phone that combines cutting-edge performance, stunning design, and an incredible camera, the OnePlus 13 is the one to get.

"I had a OnePlus 8 Pro for four and half years. It was a very nice phone having IP 68, wireless charging and Dolby Atmos.The OnePlus 13 stands out as a top-tier Android smartphone, offering a blend of performance, design, and innovation. Its 6.8-inch QHD+ AMOLED display delivers vibrant visuals with a smooth 120Hz refresh rate, ensuring an immersive viewing experience. Powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and up to 16GB of RAM, the device handles multitasking and demanding applications with ease. The triple 50MP rear camera system, developed in collaboration with Hasselblad, captures detailed and color-accurate photos across various lighting conditions. A substantial 6,000mAh battery provides impressive longevity, and with 100W wired fast charging, the phone reaches a full charge swiftly. The inclusion of IP68 and IP69 water resistance, along with MagSafe support, adds to its premium appeal. Running on OxygenOS 15 based on Android 15, the OnePlus 13 offers a clean and responsive user interface. Overall, it presents a compelling package for those seeking a high-end smartphone experience.I am definitely missing Dolby Atmos in this device for sure. Rest everything is fine.",2025-02-05,mobile
"Upgraded to the 16GB-512GB version from my Google Pixel mainly for the battery and camera. And I am absolutely loving it! If you are trying to decide if it is a good phone, it definitely is. OnePlus is offering a 7k exchange bonus till Jan-end, so you can toss away any old working or non-working phone to get a decent discount. With the exchange and Republic Day offers, I got it for around 60K which I feel is a steal. I got the Midnight Ocean variant especially for the textured blue back and it does feel premium.I preferred OP13 over the awesome Samsung S23 ultra mainly because Samsung is not extending the OS updates promise like it did for S24 ultra. Being released this year, OP13 should get at least 4 years of OS updates.DISPLAYThe ProXDR QXD+ LTPO AMOLED display is amazing as expected. In direct sunlight you may need to increase the brightness to near full. The 120Hz refresh rate gives flicker-free screen transitions. Color reproduction is great too. I keep the Always-On display mode that I fell in love with on my previous Pixel. The edge-to-edge display with mildly bent edges and corners offers a lot of real estate. It's a relatively big phone but is not that heavy and can comfortably fit a men's jeans pocket.HARDWAREThe Snapdragon Elite is really snappy! No issues running anything or even many things. I am not a gamer, but have not experienced any heating issues so far. Apart from the 16GB RAM, it adds another virtual 12GB RAM making it a whopping 30GB RAM beast. The half a TB of RAM is almost fully available for shooting hi-res videos or loading big games as the OS and apps occupy less than 50GB of space. It comes with two nano SIM slots. Of course  it supports eSIMs too, but guess you can have only upto two active at a time. Apart from the usual sensors that are standard in most phones nowadays, it comes with a Color temperature sensor, Compass, Ultrasonic fingerprint, Hall sensor, Laser focus sensor, Spectral sensors and Infrared remote control. It also supports the latest standards in most areas - Bluetooth 5.4, WiFi 7, NFC and all GPS systems including NavIC. There is no SD card slot but as the base model itself comes with 256GB, it should be more than enough for most people.SOFTWAREOne of the reasons I preferred Pixel phones was the no-bloat OS. The OxygenOS in OP15, brings all the goodies of Android 15 with hardly any bloatware and also adds some extra features and customizability. Currently, OnePlus is offering 4 OS updates and hopefully they will provide even more. There are some helpful utility apps added by OnePlus like a customizable shortcuts bar, customizable icons, audio recorders etc. Further, features like split screen, hand gestures and even face gestures are available, some probably coming from Android 15.CAMERAThe camera is awesome. Photos of day-to-day things look like professional photos. The night photos look wonderful as well. Though the built-in zoom is only 3X, it allows you to zoom in upto a mindboggling 120x! See attached photo. At such zooms you will need a tripod. The photos at big zooms will have more AI corrections but is still mostly acceptable. The 8K video capability, 480fps slo-mo etc. promises a good video experience. The portrait mode offers amazing portrait shots equivalent to Hasselblad camera lenses. The portrait mode is restricted to 3X. The camera supports live photo (moving photos), timer, palm gesture to take photos, AI enhancements etc.BATTERYThe battery with the newer Silicon NanoStack technology lives up to its reputation. It is supposed to be safer with less heating issues. Even with location on, the battery drains very slowly. I feel it can last 2 days or more with light usage. Had taken it out peak noon with brightness set to near 100%. This drained the battery faster but still had about 30% left at the end of the day. Also the bundled 100W charger can charge it up in under 40 mins. The battery, in spite of the 6000Mah capacity, is lighter than the one in OP12. It did not heat up in regular indoor use. The above noon outdoor photography along with the high outside temperature, did heat up the phone. Good thing is that it didn't seem to affect the photography. My Pixel used to refuse to use camera or upload photos to Google Photos if the phone is hot. OP13 cooled down quickly as well.SOUNDHad no issues with calls. The speakers are loud and clear as well.FINGERPRINTThe ultrasonic fingerprint is touted to be better because it can read even with wet hands or gloves. I haven't tried these use cases, but as far as normal recognition goes, it looks comparable to other fingerprint readers. At times, it misses recognising too. But, in general, the unlocking is ultra quick, thanks also to the superior hardware specs and bloat-free OS.ACCESSORIESIt comes bundled with a 100W SuperVOOC charger and a decent rubbery back case. While OP13 supports 50W wireless charging, but to use MagSafe chargers, you need to get a MagSafe compatible charging cases. I got such a case from OnePlus that had the MagSafe feature for 2K.SUMMARYIf you are ok for the price range, you can absolutely go for the OP13. I have used the phone for about a week. Will update more details and camera photos as I use it more. Hope the review was helpful.",2025-01-19,mobile

There is no SD card slot but as the base model itself comes with 256GB, it should be more than enough for most people.SOFTWAREOne of the reasons I preferred Pixel phones was the no-bloat OS. The OxygenOS in OP15, brings all the goodies of Android 15 with hardly any bloatware and also adds some extra features and customizability. Currently, OnePlus is offering 4 OS updates and hopefully they will provide even more. There are some helpful utility apps added by OnePlus like a customizable shortcuts bar, customizable icons, audio recorders etc. Further, features like split screen, hand gestures and even face gestures are available, some probably coming from Android 15.CAMERAThe camera is awesome. Photos of day-to-day things look like professional photos. The night photos look wonderful as well. Though the built-in zoom is only 3X, it allows you to zoom in upto a mindboggling 120x! See attached photo. At such zooms you will need a tripod. The photos at big zooms will have more AI corrections but is still mostly acceptable. The 8K video capability, 480fps slo-mo etc. promises a good video experience. The portrait mode offers amazing portrait shots equivalent to Hasselblad camera lenses. The portrait mode is restricted to 3X. The camera supports live photo (moving photos), timer, palm gesture to take photos, AI enhancements etc.BATTERYThe battery with the newer Silicon NanoStack technology lives up to its reputation. It is supposed to be safer with less heating issues. Even with location on, the battery drains very slowly. I feel it can last 2 days or more with light usage. Had taken it out peak noon with brightness set to near 100%. This drained the battery faster but still had about 30% left at the end of the day. Also the bundled 100W charger can charge it up in under 40 mins. The battery, in spite of the 6000Mah capacity, is lighter than the one in OP12. It did not heat up in regular indoor use. The above noon outdoor photography along with the high outside temperature, did heat up the phone. Good thing is that it didn't seem to affect the photography. My Pixel used to refuse to use camera or upload photos to Google Photos if the phone is hot. OP13 cooled down quickly as well.SOUNDHad no issues with calls. The speakers are loud and clear as well.FINGERPRINTThe ultrasonic fingerprint is touted to be better because it can read even with wet hands or gloves. I haven't tried these use cases, but as far as normal recognition goes, it looks comparable to other fingerprint readers. At times, it misses recognising too. But, in general, the unlocking is ultra quick, thanks also to the superior hardware specs and bloat-free OS.ACCESSORIESIt comes bundled with a 100W SuperVOOC charger and a decent rubbery back case. While OP13 supports 50W wireless charging, but to use MagSafe chargers, you need to get a MagSafe compatible charging cases. I got such a case from OnePlus that had the MagSafe feature for 2K.SUMMARYIf you are ok for the price range, you can absolutely go for the OP13. I have used the phone for about a week. Will update more details and camera photos as I use it more. Hope the review was helpful.",2025-01-19,mobile
